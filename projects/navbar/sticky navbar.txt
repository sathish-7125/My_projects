navbar-expand-sm - to highlight the contents in small screens. (for a responsive collapsing class)

A standard navigation bar is created with the (.navbar) class, followed by a responsive collapsing class: (.navbar-expand-xxl|xl|lg|md|sm)
(stacks the navbar vertically on xxlarge, extra large, large, medium or small screens).

To add links inside the navbar, use either an <ul> element (or a <div>) with (class="navbar-nav"). 
Then add <li> elements with a .nav-item class followed by an <a> element with a .nav-link class:

nav (navbar) / div(container-fluid) / ul(navbar-nav) / li (nav-items) / a (nav-link)

especially on small screens, you want to hide the navigation links and replace them with a button that should reveal them when clicked on.
To create a collapsible navigation bar, use a button with class="navbar-toggler", data-bs-toggle="collapse" and data-bs-target="#thetarget".
Then wrap the navbar content (links, etc) inside a <div> element with class="collapse navbar-collapse",followed by an id that matches the
data-bs-target of the button: "thetarget".

class="navbar-toggler" / data-bs-toggle="collapse" / data-bs-target="#thetarget" - To create a collapsible navigation bar, with a button.
class="collapse navbar-collapse" / data-bs-target - To wrap the navbar content like links & etc inside a div element followed by an id that matches the target id.
